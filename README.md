# QuizzicalV2 - A quiz game made with the T3 stack.

The game is playable at this URL: https://quiz.0x978.com/

This was my first time using most of the technology involved, so it is possible that some things were not followed to the best practices.

## Project Aims

The aim of Quizzicalv2 was to improve upon one of my first React projects, Quizzical by adding complete tracking of the quizzes a user completes with authentication as well as to generally improve the styling and functionality of the quiz.

## Technologies used

The stack I used for this project was the T3 stack, this included:

- Next.js
- NextAuth.js
- Prisma
- Tailwind CSS
- tRPC
- Planetscale for database hosting

## Todo

- I consider it feature complete, however I will likely add more authentication options, as well as adjust the database to be better aligned with best practices.
